# This is a pynb file which detects object and identifies it 
## It includes various libraries suchas
#### IPython.display: This library provides a set of functions for displaying images, sounds, and other objects. It offers tools for visualizing data, such as images and plots, directly within Jupyter notebooks or the IPython interactive environment.
#### Javascript: The Javascript library allows the execution of JavaScript code from Python. It can be used to interact with and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of a webpage, enabling dynamic actions and responses.
#### Image: This library is used to represent and display images in a Jupyter notebook. It provides tools for loading, saving, and displaying image data, making it easier to work with image files in a Python environment.
#### google.colab.output: The eval_js function from this library is used to evaluate JavaScript code in the output frame of a Colab notebook. It allows for communication and interaction between Python and JavaScript within the Colab environment.
#### google.colab.patches: Specifically, the cv2_imshow function from this library is a patch for OpenCV's cv2.imshow function, designed to display images directly within a Colab notebook's output cell.
#### base64: This library provides functions for encoding and decoding binary data as base64. It's often used for converting binary data, such as images, into a format that can be easily transmitted over text-based protocols, like HTTP.
#### cv2 (OpenCV): OpenCV is a popular computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of tools and functions for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning tasks, such as object detection, image enhancement, and feature extraction.
#### numpy: Numpy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
#### PIL (Python Imaging Library): Also known as the Pillow library, it provides extensive file format support, high-quality image processing, and easy manipulation of images using a simple and consistent interface.
#### io: This library provides the core tools for working with streams of data in Python. It allows for handling in-memory binary data, such as reading from or writing to a buffer.
#### html: The html library contains tools for working with HTML and escaping/unescaping characters for use in HTML documents.
#### time: This library provides various time-related functions, such as getting the current time, pausing program execution, and measuring time intervals.
#### matplotlib.pyplot: This library provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating and customizing visualizations in Python. It is often used for creating plots, charts, and other types of graphical representations of data.
